# Doogue
A roguelike-inspired pick-up-and-play raycast game. The smaller details
are not firmed up, but the core of the idea is to build a game that reflects
the experience found in the original rogue, with the visuals of DOOM and Strife.
The gameplay concept should be mostly exploritory, simple, and quick.

## Example Concepts
Ideas thrown into the pool as the core gets made

 * Directory-based Generation
 * Simple Rogue-like Generation
 * NPCs to talk and sell, quests (?), etc
 * Dungeon crawling
 * Save states (Single/limited)
 * Portable
 * Broadcast-based local multiplayer (EXTENDED)
